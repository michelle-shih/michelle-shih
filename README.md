## Hi there, I'm Michelle Shih! ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± I'm an MS Business Analytics graduate at Carnegie Mellon University
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating side projects per week to pick up new tech stacks
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about boba, coffee, anything caffeine related, or exchange cooking tips and recipes!
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out on Linkedin or through email at xshih@tepper.cmu.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I often go into hyperfocus mode where I don't sleep or eat and grind on projects until they're finished
